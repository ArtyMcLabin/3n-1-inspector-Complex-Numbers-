# 3n+1  inspector [Complex-Numbers]

Quick prototype for inspecting 3n+1 problem in complex numbers plane

Note - definition of "oddity" in complex numbers is a bit of a problematic topic. 
in this code i have chosen to define "even" as (even,even) and only it gets to the "/2 step". (odd,odd) , (odd,even) and (even_odd) are all getting "3n+1".

This code will receive 2 numbers and output the log to both cout and CSV. have fun and modify as you please!
